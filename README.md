# aemet-open

Basically, this gets Meteo data for all the meteo stations in Spain via their new OPENDATA API and writes it into an Elasticsearch index. 

The Data does not belong to me but to the Agencia Estatal de Metereolog√≠a (AEMET) of Spain. Please check their website on the re-use conditions and on how to give credit of you publish or use the data otherwise. 

I am lazy these days. Read the code and understand what it does. Plenty of comments in there. Full README.md coming soon.

Please do not use my API Key but generate your own. Info is also in the code. It has a lifetime of 90 days, so you will need to renew it periodically.
